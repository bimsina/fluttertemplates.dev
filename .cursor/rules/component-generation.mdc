When I ask you to add a component, follow these steps:

1. First, ask me for:
   - Category name (e.g., "toast", "buttons", "loading")
   - Component name (e.g., "toast_demo", "button_demo")

2. Then create the files in this order:
   a. Flutter component file:
      - Path: flutter_apps/core/lib/[category]/[component_name].dart
      - Create the file with basic component structure
      - No need to show code before creating
      - Modify the main.dart with support for the route

   b. Documentation file:
      - Path: src/content/widgets/[category]/[component_name].md
      - Include frontmatter:
        ```yaml
        ---
        title: [Component Name]
        description: A showcase of Flutter's [component] functionality
        app: core
        path: /[category]/[component_name]
        code_files: ["[category]/[component_name].dart"]
        ---
        ```
      - No need to show content before creating
      - Don't add documentation, just the frontmatter

   c. Update main.dart:
      - Add import statement
      - Add new route in switch statement
      - No need to show changes before applying

3. After all files are created:
   - Verify all paths and imports
   - Ensure proper integration
   - Test routing functionality

4. If I point out any issues:
   - Fix them immediately
   - No need to show changes before proceeding
